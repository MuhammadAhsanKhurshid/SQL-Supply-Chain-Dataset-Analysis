# SQL-Supply-Chain-Dataset-Analysis (Used Azure Data Studio for SQL Queries)
In the Supply Chain Dataset Analysis project, I conducted a thorough examination of three key datasets—Sales, Customer, and Product—employing a strategic blend of SQL queries. Initially, a basic exploration of these datasets unveiled crucial insights into the interplay between customers, products, and sales, guiding subsequent analysis. Delving deeper, I employed an array of advanced SQL techniques, including GROUP BY, CASE statements, window functions, JOIN operations, WHERE clauses, aggregate functions, and sub-queries. These complex queries enabled the extraction of key and actionable insights from the datasets, unraveling patterns, trends, and critical relationships within the supply chain. The comprehensive analysis not only provided a nuanced understanding of the dataset but also empowered informed decision-making for optimizing supply chain processes and enhancing overall operational efficiency.
